# Guess Picture Name Game 🎨

## 📌 Description
A fun interactive game where players guess the name of a displayed picture. The game uses images stored in a **Resources** folder, categorized by themes. The host can see the correct name, but players must guess. Correctly guessed images are moved to a "Removed" folder to prevent repetition in future turns.

## 🔧 Features
- 📂 **Categorized Images:** Create a theme folder (e.g., Music, Animals, Landmarks) in the "Resources" folder. Images are stored in subfolders by theme.
- 🖼️ **Randomized Display:** The game selects images randomly from a chosen theme.
- 👀 **Host Visibility:** The host can see the correct name while players guess. Names are associated with what you name the picture file.
- ✅ **Guess Validation:** If guessed correctly, the image is moved to the "Removed" folder. Ensures the same image is not used again in a single play session.


## 📝 Notes
- Ensure that images are correctly placed in the **Resources** folder.
- The "Removed" folder will store guessed images.
